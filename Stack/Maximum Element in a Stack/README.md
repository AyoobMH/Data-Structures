# Maximum Element in a Stack
An algorithm to get the maximum element of a stack when performing add and pop operations.

# Task
Implement a stack supporting the operations Push(), Pop(), and Max().

# Input Format
The first line of the input contains the number 𝑞 of queries. Each of the following 𝑞 lines
specifies a query of one of the following formats: push v, pop, or max.

# Constraints
1 ≤ 𝑞 ≤ 400 000, 0 ≤ 𝑣 ≤ 10 000.

# Output Format
For each max query, output (on a separate line) the maximum value of the stack.
